1) What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main problem that was being solved in the projects for this course was to find out which data storage technique to use for the following project. The techniques ranged from vectors, to linked-lists, to binary trees.

2) How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

For the problem I had a relatively easy approach to it. With each assignment, I was able to experience the pros and cons of each data structure and that in turn was able to help guide me in the data structure I wanted to use for this assignment. Data structures are incredibly important as they help load and keep data on file for a program to utilize within functions in order to help execute certain actions. 

3) How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

As for any roadblocks or encounters Iâ€™ve had going through the activities, I was able to easily overcome most of them. My plan of action for overcoming said problems was to either look up my questions using stack overflow with related topics, or either use Khan Academy or YouTube Videos to re-explain some of the concepts for me. 

4) How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?



5) How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
