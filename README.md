1) What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main problem that was being solved in the projects for this course was to find out which data storage technique to use for the following project. The techniques ranged from vectors, to linked-lists, to binary trees.

2) How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

For the problem I had a relatively easy approach to it. With each assignment, I was able to experience the pros and cons of each data structure and that in turn was able to help guide me in the data structure I wanted to use for this assignment. Data structures are incredibly important as they help load and keep data on file for a program to utilize within functions in order to help execute certain actions. 

3) How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

As for any roadblocks or encounters Iâ€™ve had going through the activities, I was able to easily overcome most of them. My plan of action for overcoming said problems was to either look up my questions using stack overflow with related topics, or either use Khan Academy or YouTube Videos to re-explain some of the concepts for me. 

4) How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project has really opened my eyes and expanded my approach in the way I design my software. I now see how incredibly powerful data structures are. Without a doubt this course has impacted the way I view data storage and which techniques to use when they seem to fit.

5) How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has impacted the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. It has helped me fully understand functions and their calls when displaying information as well as parsing data from different files. Thanks to learning the different techniques with data structures I can now make more maintainable programs that can open, read, and store data files for different programmable actions.
